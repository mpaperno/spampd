<H1><A NAME="description">Description</A></H1>
<P><EM>spampd</EM> is an SMTP/LMTP proxy that marks (or tags) spam using
SpamAssassin (http://www.SpamAssassin.org/). The proxy is designed
to be transparent to the sending and receiving mail servers and at no point
takes responsibility for the message itself. If a failure occurs within
<EM>spampd</EM> (or SpamAssassin) then the mail servers will disconnect and the
sending server is still responsible for retrying the message for as long
as it is configured to do so.</P>
<P><EM>spampd</EM> uses SpamAssassin to modify (tag) relayed messages based on 
their spam score, so all SA settings apply. This is described in the SA 
documentation.  <EM>spampd</EM> will by default only tell SA to tag a 
message if it exceeds the spam threshold score, however you can have 
it rewrite all messages passing through by adding the --tagall option 
(see SA for how non-spam messages are tagged).</P>
<P><EM>spampd</EM> logs all aspects of its operation to syslog(8), using the
mail syslog facility.</P>
<P>The latest version can be found at

<H1><A NAME="operation">Operation</A></H1>
<P><EM>spampd</EM> is meant to operate as an S/LMTP mail proxy which passes
each message through SpamAssassin for analysis.  Note that <EM>spampd</EM>
does not do anything other than check for spam, so it is not suitable as
an anti-relay system.  It is meant to work in conjunction with your
regular mail system.  Typically one would pipe any messages they wanted
scanned through <EM>spampd</EM> after initial acceptance by your MX host.
This is especially useful for using Postfix's (http://www.postfix.org) 
advanced content filtering mechanism, although certainly not limited to 
that application.</P>
<P>Please re-read the second sentence in the above paragraph.  You should NOT
enable <EM>spampd</EM> to listen on a public interface (IP address) unless you
know exactly what you're doing!  It is very easy to set up an open relay this
way.</P>
<P>Here are some simple examples (square brackets in the ``diagrams'' indicate
physical machines):</P>
<P><STRONG>Running between firewall/gateway and internal mail server</STRONG></P>
<P>The firewall/gateway MTA would be configured to forward all of its mail 
to the port that <EM>spampd</EM> listens on, and <EM>spampd</EM> would relay its 
messages to port 25 of your internal server. <EM>spampd</EM> could either 
run on its own host (and listen on any port) or it could run on either 
mail server (and listen on any port except port 25).</P>
<PRE>
 Internet -&gt; [ MX gateway (@inter.net.host:25) -&gt; 
        spampd (@localhost:2025) ] -&gt;
        Internal mail (@private.host.ip:25)</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Using Postfix advanced content filtering</STRONG></P>
<P>Please see the <EM>FILTER_README</EM> that came with the Postfix distribution.  You
need to have a version of Postfix which supports this (ideally v.2 and up).</P>
<PRE>
 Internet -&gt; [ Postfix (@inter.net.host:25) -&gt; 
        spampd (@localhost:10025) -&gt; 
        Postfix (@localhost:10026) ] -&gt; final delivery</PRE>
<P>Note that these examples only show incoming mail delivery.  Since it is 
usually unnecessary to scan mail coming from your network (right?),
it may be desirable to set up a separate outbound route which bypasses
<EM>spampd</EM>.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="upgrading">Upgrading</A></H1>
<P>Upgrading from version 1 simply involves replacing the <EM>spampd</EM> program file
with the latest one.  Note that the <EM>dead-letters</EM> folder is no longer being
used and the --dead-letters option is no longer needed (though no errors are
thrown if it's present).  Check the <A HREF="#options">Options</A> list below for a full list of new
and deprecated options.  Also be sure to check out the change log.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="installation">Installation</A></H1>
<P><EM>spampd</EM> can be run directly from the command prompt if desired.  This is
useful for testing purposes, but for long term use you probably want to put
it somewhere like /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin and execute it at system startup.
For example on Red Hat-style Linux system one can use a script in 
/etc/rc.d/init.d to start <EM>spampd</EM> (a sample script is available on the 
<EM>spampd</EM> Web page @ <A HREF="http://www.WorldDesign.com/index.cfm/rd/mta/spampd.htm).">http://www.WorldDesign.com/index.cfm/rd/mta/spampd.htm).</A></P>
<P>The options all have reasonable defaults, especially for a Postfix-centric
installation.  You may want to specify the --children option if you have an
especially beefy or weak server box because <EM>spampd</EM> is a memory-hungry 
program.  Check the <A HREF="#options">Options</A> for details on this and all other parameters.</P>
<P>Note that <EM>spampd</EM> <STRONG>replaces</STRONG> <EM>spamd</EM> from the <EM>SpamAssassin</EM> distribution
in function. You do not need to run <EM>spamd</EM> in order for <EM>spampd</EM> to work.
This has apparently been the source of some confusion, so now you know.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="postfixspecific notes">Postfix-specific Notes</A></H2>
<P>Here is a typical setup for Postfix ``advanced'' content filtering as described
in the <EM>FILTER_README</EM> that came with the Postfix distribution (which you 
really need to read):</P>
<P><EM>/etc/postfix/master.cf</EM>:
</P>
<PRE>

 smtp   inet    n       -       y       -       -       smtpd
        -o content_filter=smtp:localhost:10025
        -o myhostname=mx.example.com</PRE>
<PRE>
 localhost:10026        inet    n       -       n       -       10      smtpd
        -o content_filter=
        -o myhostname=mx-int.example.com</PRE>
<P>The first entry is the main public-facing MTA which uses localhost:10025
as the content filter for all mail.	The second entry receives mail from
the content filter and does final delivery.  Both smtpd instances use
the same Postfix <EM>main.cf</EM> file.  <EM>spampd</EM> is the process that listens on
localhost:10025 and then connects to the Postfix listener on localhost:10026.
Note that the <CODE>myhostname</CODE> options must be different between the two instances,
otherwise Postfix will think it's talking to itself and abort sending.</P>
<P>For the above example you can simply start <EM>spampd</EM> like this:</P>
<PRE>
 spampd --host=localhost:10025 --relayhost=localhost:10026</PRE>
<P><EM>FILTER_README</EM> from the Postfix distro has more details and examples of
various setups, including how to skip the content filter for outbound mail.</P>
<P>Another tip for Postfix when considering what timeout values to use for
--childtimout and --satimeout options is the following command:</P>
<P><CODE># postconf | grep timeout</CODE></P>
<P>This will return a list of useful timeout settings and their values.  For 
explanations see the relevant <CODE>man</CODE> page (smtp, smtpd, lmtp).  By default
<EM>spampd</EM> is set up for the default Postfix timeout values.</P>

<DD>
Specifies what hostname/IP and port <EM>spampd</EM> listens on. By default, it listens
on 127.0.0.1 (localhost) on port 10025.
<P><STRONG>Important!</STRONG> You should NOT enable <EM>spampd</EM> to listen on a
public interface (IP address) unless you know exactly what you're doing!</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Dport%3Dn"><STRONG>--port=n</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Specifies what port <EM>spampd</EM> listens on. By default, it listens on
port 10025. This is an alternate to using the above --host=ip:port notation.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Drelayhost%3Dip%5B%3Aport%5D_or_hostname%5B%3"><STRONG>--relayhost=ip[:port] or hostname[:port]</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Specifies the hostname/IP where <EM>spampd</EM> will relay all
messages. Defaults to 127.0.0.1 (localhost). If the port is not provided, that
defaults to 25.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_n"><STRONG>--relayport=n</STRONG> <CODE>(new in v2)</CODE></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Specifies what port <EM>spampd</EM> will relay to. Default is 25. This is an 
alternate to using the above --relayhost=ip:port notation.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Duser%3Dusername_or_%2D%2Du%3Dusername"><STRONG>--user=username</STRONG> or <STRONG>--u=username</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Dgroup%3Dgroupname_or_%2D%2Dg%3Dgroupname"><STRONG>--group=groupname</STRONG> or  <STRONG>--g=groupname</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Specifies the user and group that the proxy will run as. Default is
<EM>mail</EM>/<EM>mail</EM>.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><STRONG>--children=n</STRONG> or <STRONG>--c=n</STRONG> <CODE>(new in v2)</CODE></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Number of child servers to start and maintain (where n &gt; 0). Each child will 
process up to --maxrequests (below) before exiting and being replaced by 
another child.  Keep this number low on systems w/out a lot of memory. 
Default is 5 (which seems OK on a 512MB lightly loaded system).  Note that 
there is always a parent process running, so if you specify 5 children you
will actually have 6 <EM>spampd</EM> processes running.
<P>You may want to set your origination mail server to limit the 
number of concurrent connections to <EM>spampd</EM> to match this setting (for 
Postfix this is the <CODE>xxxx_destination_concurrency_limit</CODE> setting where 
'xxxx' is the transport being used, usually 'smtp', and the default is 100).</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Dmaxrequests%3Dn"><STRONG>--maxrequests=n</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
<EM>spampd</EM> works by forking child servers to handle each message. The
<STRONG>maxrequests</STRONG> parameter specifies how many requests will be handled
before the child exits. Since a child never gives back memory, a large
message can cause it to become quite bloated; the only way to reclaim
the memory is for the child to exit. The default is 20.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><STRONG>--childtimeout=n</STRONG> <CODE>(new in v2)</CODE></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This is the number of seconds to allow each child server before it times out
a transaction. In an S/LMTP transaction the timer is reset for every command. 
This timeout includes time it would take to send the message data, so it should 
not be too short.  Note that it's more likely the origination or destination
mail servers will timeout first, which is fine.  This is just a ``sane'' failsafe.
Default is 360 seconds (6 minutes).
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><STRONG>--satimeout=n</STRONG> <CODE>(new in v2)</CODE></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This is the number of seconds to allow for processing a message with
SpamAssassin (including feeding it the message, analyzing it, and adding 
the headers/report if necessary).  
This should be less than your origination and destination servers' timeout 
settings for the DATA command. For Postfix the default is 300 seconds in both
cases (smtp_data_done_timeout and smtpd_timeout). In the event of timeout
while processing the message, the problem is logged and the message is passed
on anyway (w/out spam tagging, obviously).  To fail the message with a temp
450 error, see the --dose (die-on-sa-errors) option, below.
Default is 285 seconds.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Dpid%3Dfilename_or_%2D%2Dp%3Dfilename"><STRONG>--pid=filename</STRONG> or <STRONG>--p=filename</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Specifies a filename where <EM>spampd</EM> will write its process ID so
that it is easy to kill it later. The directory that will contain this
file must be writable by the <EM>spampd</EM> user. The default is
<EM>/var/run/spampd.pid</EM>.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Dmaxsize%3Dn"><STRONG>--maxsize=n</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The maximum message size to send to SpamAssassin, in KBytes. By default messages
over 64KB are not scanned at all, and an appropriate message is logged
indicating this.  The size includes headers and attachments (if any).
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_dose"><STRONG>--dose</STRONG> <CODE>(new in v2)</CODE></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Acronym for (d)ie (o)n (s)pamAssassin (e)rrors.  By default if <EM>spampd</EM>
encounters a problem with processing the message through Spam Assassin (timeout 
or other error), it will still pass the mail on to the destination server.  If 
you specify this option however, the mail is instead rejected with a temporary 
error (code 450, which means the origination server should keep retrying to send 
it).  See the related --satimeout option, above.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Dtagall_or_%2D%2Da"><STRONG>--tagall</STRONG> or <STRONG>--a</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Tells <EM>spampd</EM> to have SpamAssassin add headers to all scanned mail,
not just spam.  By default <EM>spampd</EM> will only rewrite messages which 
exceed the spam threshold score (as defined in the SA settings).  Note that
for this option to work as of SA-2.50, the <EM>always_add_report</EM> and/or 
<EM>always_add_headers</EM> settings in your SpamAssassin <EM>local.cf</EM> need to be 
set to 1/true.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_rh"><STRONG>--log-rules-hit</STRONG> or <STRONG>--rh</STRONG> <CODE>(new in v2)</CODE></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Logs the names of each SpamAssassin rule which matched the message being 
processed.  This list is returned by SA.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_ash"><STRONG>--add-sc-header</STRONG> or <STRONG>--ash</STRONG> <CODE>(new in v2.1)</CODE></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Add a 'X-Spam-Checked-By: {hostname}' header to each scanned message.  By 
default no such header is added. This can be useful in tracking which server
in a pool did the scanning.  See below for how to specify a hostname.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_hostname"><STRONG>--hostname=hostname</STRONG> <CODE>(new in v2.1)</CODE></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Hostname to use in the X-Spam-Checked-By header. By default the value of the 
environmental variable $HOSTNAME is used, or if that is undefined/blank then
'localhost' is used as the hostname.  Only relevant if the --add-sc-header 
option is specified.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Dauto%2Dwhitelist_or_%2D%2Daw"><STRONG>--auto-whitelist</STRONG> or <STRONG>--aw</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>

that per-user whitelists are not available.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_L"><STRONG>--local-only</STRONG> or <STRONG>--L</STRONG> <CODE>(new in v2)</CODE></A></STRONG><BR>

<H1><A NAME="to do">To Do</A></H1>
<P>Figure out how to use Net::Server::PreFork because it has cool potential for
load management.  I tried but either I'm missing something or PreFork is
somewhat broken in how it works.  If anyone has experience here, please let 
me know.</P>
<P>Add configurable option for rejecting mail outright based on spam score.
It would be nice to make this program safe enough to sit in front of a mail 
server such as Postfix and be able to reject mail before it enters our systems.
The only real problem is that Postfix will see localhost as the connecting
client, so that disables any client-based checks Postfix can do and creates a 
possible relay hole if localhost is trusted.</P>
<P>Per-user preferences: The jury is still out on this one.  I'm thinking more
and more that most per-user prefs should be specified on the final mailbox
server.  Why? Because SMTP isn't designed with per-user preferences in mind.
On a relay server, the same message body can go to multiple recipients who
may have wildly different preferences when it comes to handilng junk mail.  The
exception here might be the use of LMTP protocol, which bears further
investigation.</P>
