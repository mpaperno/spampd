# SpamPD - Spam Proxy Daemon

Originally released in May of 2002, _SpamPD_ is a program used within an e-mail delivery system to scan messages for possible Unsolicited Commercial E-mail (UCE, aka spam) content.
It uses an excellent program called <a href="https://spamassassin.apache.org/" target="_new">SpamAssassin</a> (SA) to do the actual message scanning. SpamPD acts as a transparent SMTP/LMTP proxy between
two mail servers, and during the transaction it passes the mail through SA. If SA decides the mail could be spam, then SpamPD will ask SA to
add some headers and a report to the message indicating it's spam and why.

SpamPD is written in Perl and should theoretically run on any platform supported by Perl and SpamAssassin.

Here's an un-solicited comment someone sent regarding *SpamPD* performance:

> Just to let you know: We have the SA/spampd combo up an running in a high volume environment. With 3 KAT-B Server (4x 2,5 GHz Xeon MP
with Hyperthreading, 3 GB RAM) we handle 15.000 to 20.000 Mails/h (Hour!) with room to spare. We had some performance issues with the
Bayes databases but now everything runs smoothly.

(Note that the Debian package version was added to this repo as a branch, and those tags will also show up in the Releases page.)

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p><i>SpamPD</i> was initially designed as a content filter mechanism for use with the <a href="http://www.postfix.org/"><i>Postfix</i></a> MTA.
However, it has no inherent dependencies on <i>Postfix</i> or any other MTA.
Some more specific setup information is provided <a href="https://github.com/mpaperno/spampd/blob/master/spampd.pod#installation-and-configuration">in the included documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Version 2 Architecture</h2>
<p>Version 2 of <i>SpamPD</i> is a major rewrite of the underlying methods. <i>SpamPD</i>
 no longer acts as a relay server but more as a "transparent" proxy
server. That is, it never actually takes responsibility for the mail at
any point. Instead, the origination and destination mail servers speak
directly to each other. If a failure occurs within <i>SpamPD</i>
 (or SpamAssassin) during a transaction, then the mail servers will
disconnect and the sending server is still responsible for retrying the
message for as long as it is configured to do so. Responsibility for
mail delivery always lies with the 2 mail servers, which would be "real"
 MTAs and not a 500 line Perl script :-) This removes a major problem
with version 1 of <i>SpamPD</i>, and makes this a <u>recommended upgrade</u>.</p>
<p>While this is a much safer technique than previously employed, it does remove a possible feature which some users of <i>SpamPD</i>
 have implemented (sorry guys). That is redirecting spam to a spamtrap
address instead of letting the message through to the original
recipient. This is due to the fact that the recipient information is
passed on to the destination server before the message data is scanned
for spam. On the other hand it presents the possibility of rejecting
spam at the S/LMTP level without having to generate bounce notices and
such.</p>

<p><i>SpamPD</i> now fully supports the LMTP
 protocol (due to the nature of it's new transparency). Logging has been
 improved and is now more compatible with <code>spamd</code>.
 New parameters added: --children, --local-only, --childtimeout,
--satimeout, --dose, --log-rules-hit, --add-sc-header, and --hostname.
Three parameters are now deprecated: --dead-letters, --heloname, and
--stop-at-threshold.</p>

<h2>More Information</h2>

<p>If you aren't familiar with <a href="http://www.SpamAssassin.org/">SpamAssassin</a>,
 then you should definitely start there (or end up there) first. There
is a very helpful users discussion list for SA (see their site). For <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a> setup, be sure to read the FILTER_README document that is included with the distribution. <i>SpamPD</i> is meant to be used as an "advanced content filtering" method (some examples are included with the <i>SpamPD</i>
 documentation). Postfix also has a helpful users discussion list. Make
sure you do your homework before you ask other people to help you!</p>
